# Trademark Notice

## The "Valksor Go Toolkit" Name

The name **"Valksor Go Toolkit"** is a trademark of Dāvis Zālītis and SIA Valksor.

## What This Means

You are free to:

- **Fork** the source code and modify it
- **Redistribute** the code under the BSD-3 license
- **Use** the code in commercial or personal projects
- **Create** derivative works and tools

However, forks and redistributions **must not** use the "Valksor Go Toolkit" name without explicit written permission.

## Naming Your Fork

When forking or redistributing modified versions, you must:

1. **Choose a different name** — Do not call your project "Valksor Go Toolkit" or confusingly similar names
2. **Remove references** — Update documentation, README, and code to use your new name
3. **Be clear** — State that your project is a fork or derivative work, not the original

Good examples: `YourName-Go-Utils`, `YourProject-Fork`, `go-toolkit-community`

## Why?

This trademark exists to **prevent confusion**. Users should know whether they're using the original go-toolkit or a third-party fork. The code is open and free; the brand identity is not.
